# keyboard-display-interaction

An interactive React-based application to visualize the stages of text processing, from keyboard input to display output. This project provides an educational and visually engaging way to explore how text flows through components like the keyboard, controller, operating system, buffer, and display.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Enter text and observe real-time processing through multiple stages.
- **Detailed Stages**:
  - **Keyboard Input**: Converts key presses to scan codes.
  - **Controller**: Translates scan codes to keycodes.
  - **Operating System**: Processes keycodes, applies layouts, and manages input events.
  - **Buffer Update**: Prepares data for rendering on the display.
  - **Display Output**: Renders text to the screen with visual effects.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over stages to view descriptions of their functionalities.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both small and large screens.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter text into the input field.
2. Click **Process** to visualize each stage of text processing.
3. Observe real-time updates and tooltips explaining each stage's role.
4. The processed text is displayed as output on the simulated screen.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **Lucide-React Icons**: Used for stage-specific icons.
- **Framer Motion**: Enhances animations and transitions.
